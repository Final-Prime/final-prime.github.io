# Final Prime public site

This repository contains the public website for **Final Prime™**.

## Current owner

Original Final Prime materials are currently owned by **Daniel Kenessy**, acting in an individual capacity, unless a file or notice identifies another owner or license. No rights have been assigned to a company.

Any future transfer to a company requires a separate signed assignment. GitHub organization ownership, repository hosting, domains, or public presentation do not by themselves transfer copyright or trademark rights.

The website uses a conservative, logic-oriented visual language, orthogonal geometry, fuchsia and cyan signal modes, explicit public and private boundaries, and progressive enhancement. Core content remains usable without JavaScript.

Platform raster icons are derived from `assets/mark.svg`. Normal and maskable icons remain separate because maskable assets require a larger safe area; do not combine their manifest `purpose` values.

The first published review record is `FP-REV-0001`, available at `/reviews/metro-2033-redux/`.

`/llms.txt` is a machine-readable map of the same nine indexable public routes. It is a navigation aid only and does not grant access, reuse, training, or other rights.
